<h2>1. Diagnose the Problems</h2>
<h4>
    On this project, we started from 0. Our goal was to make an app for people to use daily. We began by pitching out different ideas. After that, we selected dietary as our main character. Then, we started interviewing people to see if they had any pain points in choosing their food. We found that many people have different allergins, and sometimes it is hard to find an allergin-free diet easily from our interviewees, which became our theme. Here is our brainstorming process:

    <h2>2. Sketch Wireframe</h2>
    <h4>
        Now we understand what our target users want— an easy way to access allergen-friendly recipes. Even though knowing what they need and what features they desire, nicely putting all the elements in one place is still a tough job. We used sketches to lead us to different versions of it. We tried to keep it low-fi to ensure we don’t waste too much time working on a version we won’t use in the future. Here is our low-fi prototype:

   <h2>3. Digital Wireframe</h2>
   <h4>
    Now we have established the direction that we are going to go along.  It’s time to put some more detail into our project. We tried to make it function as the actual app since this step is typically what the stakeholders or the employers see and decide if they want to put their money into this project. We used many interaction functions and many details that we hope to meet our customers’ expectations. Here is our clickable prototype; you can click in and try it yourself:
