        <h2>Farmland Rent Reduction</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            The first land policy was "Farmland Rent Reduction" When Taiwan was under Japanese rule, due to its overpopulation, landlords with large amounts of land could decide who could rent the area (there was high demand, but the land belonged to a small group of people). Tenants must deliver all crops except the seed portion. When a natural disaster or crop failure occurs, they are still required to provide all rent to the landlord. In the past, the rent was called "iron rent", which means that their rights are not protected, and even if they don't have enough rights, they still need to give up everything.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first land policy is to change that. The ROC government used to implement a 50% rent policy in China, which meant that the rent could not be higher than 50% of the crops. In April 1949, Taiwan Provincial President Chen Cheng announced a new land policy "37.5% reduction of cultivated land rent law". It reduces the 50% rent by 25%, resulting in the following formula:
        </p>

        <p class="math">50% x (1-0.25) = 37.5%</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 1rem">
            <li>Landlords are not allowed to rent land in advance. If the crops fail, then the rent should be lower.</li>
            <li>The rental contract should be no less than six years.</li>
            <li>When the contract expires, if the landlord does not intend to take it back to homesteading, it should be leased to the tenant.</li>
            <li>
                If the landlord plans to sell the land, the tenant has priority in buying it.</li>
            <li>Every town needs to have a rent association to deal with land claims or disputes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Sales of Public Farmlands</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            The following policy is "Sales of Public Farmlands."  According to a report by Taiwan's National Development Council, public land in Taiwan is land owned by the Japanese government, private companies and individuals. The land area is about 1760 square kilometers. From 1951 to 1976, the ROC government conducted 9 public land transactions for sale. The land price is 2.5 times the annual rice production of the land. People have to pay the price through crops or cash for ten years. The purpose of this policy is to make the people self-sufficient. The policy benefited 288,627 households and 139,757,000 square meters of land was sold.

        <h2>Land Cultivation Plan</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>In 1953, two years after the "Sales of Public Farmland," the ROC government announced a new land policy, the "Land Cultivation Procedure". This policy enables landlords to keep only a portion of their land, which the government then takes and distributes to people. Landlords receive some compensation from the government, including government-owned stock in the company.</p>
