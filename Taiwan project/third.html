            <h2>Taiwan Light Industry and Heavy Industry</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>The first policy is the "rice-fertilizer barter scheme". The policy is "Fertilizer is for rice." Farmers cannot buy any fertilizer themselves; instead, the government controls 100% of the fertilizer; the only source of fertilizer is the government. The exchange rate is 1.5 kg of fertilizer: 1 kg of rice.

        </p>
        <p>By implementing this policy, the government has achieved some positive results. According to Taiwan Encyclopedia, the following points are the results:</p>
        <ol style="margin-left: 1rem;">
            <li>The government has reduced the income of farmers, and since the income of this industry is relatively high, farmers in rural areas, women in their families all come to the factory. It increases the labor supply.</li>
            <li>By doing this, the government controls the rice in the market, so they are able to control the price of rice and keep it down. Rice prices are more stable.</li>
            <li>The government bought the rice at a lower price, and they used that money to pay government workers, teachers, and soldiers.</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <div class="center">
            <p>The government of the Republic of China has set up many protective measures for Taiwan's "immature industries" so that Taiwan can develop products with low technology requirements, low investment, high labor force and national needs. 1. Restrict the import of food, soap, clothes and other items. 2. Increase import tariffs. 3. Reduce export tariffs. The purpose of all these policies is to encourage "light industry" to produce for Taiwan's needs. According to Taiwan Encyclopedia, by 1954, there were no textile imports, and by 1957, the production volume of the cement industry was high enough to stop importing any cement.</p>
            <p>After "import substitution", there are many reasons to take the next step in development. According to Taiwan Encyclopedia, more than one million people are required to work on farms due to great advances in agricultural production technology. Also, since 1958, they need to sell their products overseas because the demand inside Taiwan is too small and the factories are producing more than they need. On the other hand, the government also encourages other countries to invest in Taiwan. In September 1960, the government announced the "Investment Encouragement Regulations", which reduced export duties and established export processing zones. This unique area has attracted investors to build factories and then export products all over the world, hence the development is called "Export Oriented". 679/5000 Export Processing Zones is an important current development. The Taiwanese government created a special zone at the seaport and encouraged investors to set up factories, thereby reducing export duties, lowering rents, etc. Kaohsiung Export Processing Zone is the first zone in the world. Products produced in the zone are exempt from paying taxes until exported. The great success of Taiwan's export processing zones has brought many job opportunities. Kaohsiung is today the second largest city in Taiwan. Kaohsiung Port is also the largest port in Taiwan.</p>
