                Taiwan is an island in the Pacific Ocean. Today, different groups of people live on this island, including Hokkien, Hakka, Chinese from other provinces, Taiwanese aborigines, and immigrants from Southeast Asia. Before World War II, Taiwan was a colony of Japan. In 1895, due to the failure of the first Anti-Japanese War, China granted Taiwan, the Liaodong Peninsula, and other places to Japan. After World War II, the government of the Republic of China moved to Taiwan and began building the island. When the ROC government arrived in Taiwan in 1949,
Nearly 2 million soldiers and their families also immigrated to Taiwan. When the ROC government arrived in Taiwan, many things were to be resolved. At the end of World War II in 1945, Taiwan's economic and health conditions were low. The government of the Republic of China exerted a significant influence on the development of Taiwan,

                When the R.O.C. government arrived in Taiwan, the first thing they did was a series of land policies. But, first, they amended the act to be less tied to the Chinese bill system and issued Taiwan dollars.
 Afterward, they established many rules for the farmers to be self-sufficient. The second step in improving the economic situation is to develop the "light industry.” The government began to help set up small factories producing textiles, shoes, and paper. This helped Taiwan prepare to move to "heavy industry.”
To stimulate investment, the government encourages investors from around the world to set up factories in Taiwanese ports. This time it is the third step of development. This site will talk about what's happening in Taiwan, Taiwan's policies and changes, and who's going to help and make all of these things work.
